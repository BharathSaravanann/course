# Defensive programming                             4/8/2024


How to know the program getting the right answers.

1. write program that checks there own actions.

2. write and run for widely used function.

3. what correct actually means.

## Assertion.

```

numbers = [1.5, 2.3, 0.7, -0.001, 4.4]
total=0.0
for num in numbers:
    assert num > 0.0
    total+=num
print(total)

```
It will gives the error message, because the condition is not true (assert)


`precondition` - The code should be true when staring.

`postcondition` - It should be true at the end.

`invariant` - It should be true while running inside the code.

# Command line arguments.

`python readings_04.py --mean inflammation-01.csv` - finding mean through command line.

`head -4 inflammation-01.csv | python readings_06.py --min` - printing first 4 lines and finding the minimum value.

`python readings_04.py --max inflammation-*.csv` - Finding maximum.

Indicating through terminal that --max,--min, --mean what statistics we are using.

```
import sys
sys.version

```
simply creating .py version file and finding the version.

`sys.argv` - This will collect all the commands in the command line and create a list of arguments.

```
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
    for row_mean in numpy.mean(data, axis=1):
        print(row_mean)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

we are importing the first arv and finding mean in that and called by using `if __name__ = '__main__'`
`main()` To call the main.

For multiple files we need to use `argparse` library.

`sys.argv[0]` - This will be always the name of our script.

`sys.stdin` - For standard input.

```
import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script=sys.argv[0]
    action=sys.argv[1]
    filenames=sys.argc[2:]
    for file in filenames:
        data=np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=",")

        if action=="--min":
            values=np.amin(data,axis=0)
        elif action=="--max":
            values=np.amax(data,axis=0)
        elif action=="--mean":
            values=np.mean(data,axis=0)
        else:
            pass

    for val in values:
        print(val)

if __name__ =="__main__":
    main()
        
```
creating a function for multiple files and also setting a action.
