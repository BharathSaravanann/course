# 25/07/24 - GIT and CONDA/MAMBA Notes

## GIT

 ```git init```
Initialize git inside a current directory and it tells git to track.

```git status```
To check the last commit and changes. If it shows that there is no git-based directory, it means it will not be tracked by git. If the directory is git tracked, using `ls -a` will show a hidden `./git` directory which contains all the information for git to make version control over all the files. This is the most commonly used command to check the status of git on a remote repository.

```git add```
It helps to stage the file in the local repository.

```git commit```
This is like making a subject for the envelope and we are committing the changes that we have made.

```git diff```
It will show the edited areas by `-` and `+`.

```git reset HEAD or git restore```
For unstaging the added file from git.

```git rm filename```
It will delete the file from the remote repo directly.

```git log```
It helps to view the past commit changes in the repository.

```.gitignore```
Specify the files that we don't need to commit.

```.gitignore_global```
To make this file in the home directory to use for all different repositories.

```git branch```
Check the current working branch.

```git branch <newbranchname>```
To create a new branch.

```git checkout <newbranch>```
To switch to the newly created branch.

```git checkout -b <new_branch>```
To create a new branch and checkout.

```git log --graph --all --oneline```
To visualize the commit and changes in one line.

```git branch -d <delete>```
To delete the branch.

```git tag "<info>"```
Specify any version change.

```git tag```
To list all the tags.

```git remote add origin <path to remote server>```
To connect from local to remote repo.

```git remote -v```
To get the repo in the local directory.

```git fetch```
To fetch remote changes without merging.

```git pull```
To get the files from the remote repo with the changes.

```git clone <path/to/directory>```
To connect from different computers to the remote repository.

## CONDA/MAMBA

```conda create -n <env_name> -c bioconda -c conda-forge <tool_name>```
Use conda to create an environment and use channels to fetch data from bioconda and conda-forge, and the tool name that we need to download.

```conda activate <env_name>```
To activate the created environment.

```conda deactivate <env_name>```
To deactivate the environment.

```conda env list / conda info --envs```
To know the available environments.

```conda list```
To get the packages inside the environment.

```conda install <tool_name>=<version>```
To install tools with the specified version.

```conda search <tool_name> -c bioconda```
To search for the availability of the tools in the mentioned channel.

```conda remove <package>```
To remove the existing package in the environment.

```conda env remove -n <env_name>```
To remove the already existing environment.

```conda clean -a```
To clear cache.

```environment.yml
channels:
  - bioconda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - tools```

This is  a way to create a yml file for our dependencies. 

```conda env create -n <env_name> -f environment.yml``` command to run the conda with environment.yml file with the dependencies. Instead of -n use -p for specify the path to store the env.

```conda env export``` To export the version that we have already used.
